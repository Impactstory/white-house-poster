white-house-poster
==================

This poster was originally presented as part of the [White House Open Science Champions of Change event](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/06/21/celebrating-open-science-champions-change-white-house) on June 20, 2013. It's a living document and is being actively updated.

If you'd like to use part or all of the poster as part of your own presentation, great! That's what it's here for. No need to inform us you're using it, although if you do it'll probably make our day :)
